# PasswordGenerator2

In this project, I created a javascript code that would generate a random password based on certain parameters including 
  1. length of between 8 and 128 characters
  2. can include numbers
  3. special characters
  4. lowercase letters and
  5. uppercase letters.

The generator was started by a button click and completed through the use of prompts, with messages if any errors occured.  The finished site can be found here:

The repository is here:

and the final result looks like this:![Screenshot (15)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86876335/128613309-291123aa-a19e-475b-97bf-934dba53f4a7.png)
